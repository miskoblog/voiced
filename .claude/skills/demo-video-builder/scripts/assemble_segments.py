"""Segment-level assembly — pairs with record_demo.js's per-segment isolated
recordings.

Each beat's recordings/<beat>/manifest.json lists its segments in order; each
segment has its own isolated webm (recordings/<beat>/segNN/*.webm) and its own
clicks.json ({"visibleStart": <seconds>, "clicks": [<seconds>, ...]} — both
relative to that segment's own recording, not the whole beat).

For each segment: trim off the invisible-but-actually-visible setup/replay
prefix (everything before visibleStart — see record_demo.js's file header),
mix the synthesized click sound into that segment's voiceover clip at the
logged click moments, pad whichever of video/audio is shorter (freeze last
video frame, or add silence) so the two match exactly, then concatenate all of
a beat's segments (hard cut — it's the same continuous screen, no transition
needed within a beat) and finally join all beats with a fade-through-color
"dip" between EVERY beat — including into and out of the hook.

Beat transitions deliberately do NOT use xfade/acrossfade. See
dip_transition_concat() below and ffmpeg-cookbook.md section 4b for the three
separate reasons that approach was abandoned after a real client delivery; the
short version is that overlapping blends silently failed past the first join,
were invisible where adjacent frames were near-identical by design, and made
narration audibly dip where two speech clips overlapped.

COPY THIS FILE and adapt paths/beat list to the real project. The hook beat
("00-hook" by convention) has no recording — it's a still frame (the
main-product screenshot from Phase 1) held for the length of its narration,
deliberately with NO zoom/pan (a Ken-Burns effect was tried and explicitly
rejected — it read as filler motion, not a demo of anything).

Usage: assemble_segments.py <output.mp4> <beat-name> [beat-name ...]
       (use "00-hook" for the still-frame hook beat)

    """Join beats with a fade-through-FADE_COLOR dip, then a hard concat.

    Each clip is faded INDEPENDENTLY (out to the colour on its tail, in from the
    colour on its head), audio faded to and from silence the same way, and only
    then concatenated. Nothing overlaps. That is the whole design, and every part
    of it replaces something that failed on a real delivery:

    1. NOT xfade/acrossfade chains. Eight beats chained as 7 xfade+acrossfade
       pairs in one filter_complex rendered only the FIRST join as a real blend;
       every later join computed a correct offset and still came out a hard cut,
       with no error or warning. If you ever do reach for xfade, never put more
       than 2 inputs in one filter graph and materialise each intermediate to
       disk — but you shouldn't need it at all, because:
    2. A cross-dissolve is invisible here by construction. Each beat's setup()
       re-primes the app to the state the previous beat ended on (deliberately,
       for continuity), so the frames either side of a join are often
       near-identical — dissolving a frame into a copy of itself looks like
       nothing happened. Dipping through a colour is visible regardless of how
       similar the neighbours are.
    3. Overlapping two different narration clips sounds wrong. acrossfade
       between two unrelated speech waveforms produced an audible mid-transition
       volume dip whatever curve was used. Fading to silence and back cannot:
       there's only ever one voice audible.

    Because each clip's fade is timed off its own measured video-stream duration,
    there's no cumulative offset arithmetic to drift — which is the other half of
    why the old chained version was fragile.
